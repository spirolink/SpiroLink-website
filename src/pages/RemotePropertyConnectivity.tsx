            Your remote property should not mean remote from reliable internet. Today, guests expect Wi-Fi everywhere, staff depend on connectivity for coordination, and business operations (payments, bookings, security) rely on stable service—whether you run a ranch, wedding venue, winery, resort, or multi-building property.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Traditional providers often will not extend cable or fiber to rural properties, and even when they will, the cost and timeline can be unrealistic. Many owners try quick fixes—extenders, consumer mesh kits, multiple hotspots—but performance becomes inconsistent when the property is large, buildings are spread out, or weekends bring heavy usage. The result is frustration, downtime risk, and reputational damage.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            SpiroLink delivers complete, property-wide connectivity as one engineered system—reliable internet, building-to-building links, enterprise Wi-Fi, phones, and security—designed to perform under real load and handed over with clear documentation. We use the right mix of technologies based on your location and layout, so the solution feels simple to operate and "just works."

            <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">We are in a remote area. Can we really get reliable internet?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700">Yes. Location does not limit connectivity anymore. Even if cable or fiber providers will not serve your property, we design solutions that bring stable, high-speed internet to remote farms, rural land, and large properties.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Will the internet work across the entire property, not just one building?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700">Yes. We design connectivity for the full property, not just a single office. Homes, barns, guest houses, halls, sheds, and outdoor areas can all be connected as one seamless network.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">We have multiple buildings spread far apart. Do we need to dig trenches?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700">No. In most cases, there is no digging or trenching required. Buildings are connected wirelessly in a secure and permanent way, saving cost, time, and disruption to land or landscaping.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Will guests or workers slow down the internet for everyone else?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700">No. The network is designed to manage usage automatically. Guest usage, staff operations, and business systems are separated so one group cannot affect the performance of another.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Can this support phones, cameras, payment machines, and smart devices?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700">Yes. The network supports: Internet for phones, laptops, and tablets, security cameras across the property, payment systems and booking tools, smart TVs, speakers, and automation devices. All are designed to work together reliably.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">What happens if the internet goes down during an event or busy day?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700">Our designs include redundancy and fail-safe planning. If one connection is disrupted, the system switches automatically so operations continue without interruption.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Do we need technical staff to manage this?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700">No. The system is designed to be simple to operate. We provide training, clear documentation, and optional remote monitoring so you are not dependent on on-site IT expertise.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Can this grow if we add more buildings or expand the property?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700">Yes. The network is built with expansion in mind. New buildings, guest areas, or operations can be added without redesigning everything from scratch.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Is this a temporary setup or a long-term solution?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700">This is a permanent infrastructure investment, not a temporary workaround. The system is engineered for years of reliable operation and adapts as your business grows.</p>
          </div>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">How long does it take to get everything working?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700">Most properties are fully connected within 4–8 weeks, depending on size and layout—far faster than traditional providers, which often take many months or never deliver.</p>

            <p className="text-slate-700">We begin with a simple conversation: Understand your property layout, understand how you use the internet, identify what must work without fail. From there, we design the right solution—before you commit to anything.</p>
